# About project

Project in corroboration with [Sheaza](https://github.com/Sheaza) for image processing [class](https://fraktal.faculty.wmi.amu.edu.pl/image_processing/) on UAM.


The goal is to create a simple window application with all essential algorithms from a program like GIMP.


# Milestones 

* Creating a app to load, save and display images with extensions like ppm,pgm,pbm and others stored equally in ASCII and in byte code


* Adding the following features for images: desaturation, negative, contrast, brightness, saturation, sum, subtraction, multiplication, monochrome transformations


* Generating, stretching and equalizing a histogram of a image both in grayscale and in RGB


* Creating a class that allows to define custom convolution mask, adding filters: uniform blur, gaussian blur, sharpen, Sobel, Previtt, Roberts, Laplacian, LoG


* Implementation of Canny algorithm with interface


* Implementation of Hough transformation with slider interface for setting the threshold


* Implementation of Harris algorithm for corner detection along with the thresholding interface


* Implementation of watershed segmentation by embedding using the Vincent-Soille algorithm


* Morphological operations: dilation, erosion, hit and miss, bold, rub
